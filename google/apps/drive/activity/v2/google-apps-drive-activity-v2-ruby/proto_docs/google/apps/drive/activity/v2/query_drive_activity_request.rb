          #     Return activities for this Drive folder and all children and descendants.
          #     The format is `items/ITEM_ID`.
          # @!attribute [rw] consolidation_strategy
          #   @return [::Google::Apps::Drive::Activity::V2::ConsolidationStrategy]
          #     Details on how to consolidate related actions that make up the activity. If
          #     not set, then related actions are not consolidated.
          # @!attribute [rw] page_size
          #   @return [::Integer]
          #     The miminum number of activities desired in the response; the server will
          #     attempt to return at least this quanitity. The server may also return fewer
          #     activities if it has a partial response ready before the request times out.
          #     If not set, a default value is used.
          # @!attribute [rw] page_token
          #   @return [::String]
          #     The token identifying which page of results to return. Set this to the
          #     next_page_token value returned from a previous query to obtain the
          #     following page of results. If not set, the first page of results will be
          #     returned.
          # @!attribute [rw] filter
          #   @return [::String]
          #     The filtering for items returned from this query request. The format of the
          #     filter string is a sequence of expressions, joined by an optional "AND",
          #     where each expression is of the form "field operator value".
          #
          #     Supported fields:
          #
          #       - `time`: Uses numerical operators on date values either in
          #         terms of milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970 or in RFC 3339 format.
          #         Examples:
          #           - `time > 1452409200000 AND time <= 1492812924310`
          #           - `time >= "2016-01-10T01:02:03-05:00"`
          #
          #       - `detail.action_detail_case`: Uses the "has" operator (:) and
          #         either a singular value or a list of allowed action types enclosed in
          #         parentheses.
          #         Examples:
          #           - `detail.action_detail_case: RENAME`
          #           - `detail.action_detail_case:(CREATE EDIT)`
