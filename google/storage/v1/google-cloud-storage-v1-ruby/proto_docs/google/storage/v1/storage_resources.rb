      #     event occurs, signified by the
      #     hold's release. After being released, such objects will be subject to
      #     bucket-level retention (if any).  One sample use case of this flag is for
      #     banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in
      #     full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being
      #     paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any
      #     number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the
      #     object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention
      #     duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold
      #     transitioned from true to false.  Objects under event-based hold cannot be
      #     deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed.

      #     The bucket's retention policy. The retention policy enforces a minimum
      #     retention time for all objects contained in the bucket, based on their
      #     creation time. Any attempt to overwrite or delete objects younger than the
      #     retention period will result in a PERMISSION_DENIED error.  An unlocked
      #     retention policy can be modified or removed from the bucket via a

      #     removed or shortened in duration for the lifetime of the bucket.

      #     retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the
      #     hold's release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set
      #     to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any).
      #     One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at
      #     least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3
      #     years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these
      #     objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has
      #     occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years
      #     after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the
      #     moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.
