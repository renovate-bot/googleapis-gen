    Attributes:
        bucket (str):
            The name of the bucket containing the object
            to read.
        object_ (str):
            The name of the object to read.
        generation (int):
            If present, selects a specific revision of
            this object (as opposed to the latest version,
            the default).
        read_offset (int):
            The offset for the first byte to return in the read,
            relative to the start of the object.

            A negative ``read_offset`` value will be interpreted as the
            number of bytes back from the end of the object to be
            returned. For example, if an object's length is 15 bytes, a
            ReadObjectRequest with ``read_offset`` = -5 and
            ``read_limit`` = 3 would return bytes 10 through 12 of the
            object. Requesting a negative offset whose magnitude is
            larger than the size of the object will result in an error.
        read_limit (int):
            The maximum number of ``data`` bytes the server is allowed
            to return in the sum of all ``Object`` messages. A
            ``read_limit`` of zero indicates that there is no limit, and
            a negative ``read_limit`` will cause an error.

            If the stream returns fewer bytes than allowed by the
            ``read_limit`` and no error occurred, the stream includes
            all data from the ``read_offset`` to the end of the
            resource.
        if_generation_match (int):
            Makes the operation conditional on whether
            the object's current generation matches the
            given value. Setting to 0 makes the operation
            succeed only if there are no live versions of
            the object.
            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_if_generation_match``.

            Makes the operation conditional on whether
            the object's current generation does not match
            the given value. If no live object exists, the
            precondition fails. Setting to 0 makes the
            operation succeed only if there is a live
            version of the object.

        location_type (str):
            Output only. The location type of the bucket
            (region, dual-region, multi-region, etc).
        storage_class (str):
            The bucket's default storage class, used whenever no
            storageClass is specified for a newly-created object. This
            defines how objects in the bucket are stored and determines
            the SLA and the cost of storage. If this value is not
            specified when the bucket is created, it will default to
            ``STANDARD``. For more information, see

            Management] for more information.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):

            The bucket's [https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/][Cross-Origin
            Resource Sharing] (CORS) config.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The modification time of the bucket. Attempting
            to set or update this field will result in a
            [FieldViolation][google.rpc.BadRequest.FieldViolation].
        default_event_based_hold (bool):
            The default value for event-based hold on
            newly created objects in this bucket.  Event-
            based hold is a way to retain objects
            indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by
            the
            hold's release. After being released, such
            objects will be subject to bucket-level
            retention (if any).  One sample use case of this
            flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at
            least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here,
            bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event
            is loan being paid in full. In this example,
            these objects will be held intact for any number
            of years until the event has occurred (event-
            based hold on the object is released) and then 3
            more years after that. That means retention
            duration of the objects begins from the moment
            event-based hold transitioned from true to
            false.  Objects under event-based hold cannot be
            deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold
            is removed.
        labels (Sequence[google.storage_v2.types.Bucket.LabelsEntry]):
            User-provided labels, in key/value pairs.
        website (google.storage_v2.types.Bucket.Website):
            The bucket's website config, controlling how the service
            behaves when accessing bucket contents as a web site. See
            the
            [https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/static-website][Static
            Website Examples] for more information.
        versioning (google.storage_v2.types.Bucket.Versioning):
            The bucket's versioning config.
        logging (google.storage_v2.types.Bucket.Logging):
            The bucket's logging config, which defines
            the destination bucket and name prefix (if any)
            for the current bucket's logs.
        owner (google.storage_v2.types.Owner):
            Output only. The owner of the bucket. This is
            always the project team's owner group.
        encryption (google.storage_v2.types.Bucket.Encryption):
            Encryption config for a bucket.
        billing (google.storage_v2.types.Bucket.Billing):
            The bucket's billing config.
        retention_policy (google.storage_v2.types.Bucket.RetentionPolicy):
            The bucket's retention policy. The retention policy enforces
            a minimum retention time for all objects contained in the
            bucket, based on their creation time. Any attempt to
            overwrite or delete objects younger than the retention
            period will result in a PERMISSION_DENIED error. An unlocked
            retention policy can be modified or removed from the bucket
            via a storage.buckets.update operation. A locked retention
            policy cannot be removed or shortened in duration for the
            lifetime of the bucket. Attempting to remove or decrease
            period of a locked retention policy will result in a
            PERMISSION_DENIED error.
        iam_config (google.storage_v2.types.Bucket.IamConfig):
            The bucket's IAM config.
        zone_affinity (Sequence[str]):
            Immutable. The zone or zones from which the
            bucket is intended to use zonal quota. Requests
            for data from outside the specified affinities
            are still allowed but won't be able to use zonal
            quota. The values are case-insensitive.
            Attempting to update this field after bucket is
            created will result in an error.

        delete_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The deletion time of the object. Will be
            returned if and only if this version of the object has been
            deleted. Attempting to set or update this field will result

        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The modification time of the object metadata.
            Attempting to set or update this field will result in a
            [FieldViolation][google.rpc.BadRequest.FieldViolation].
        kms_key (str):
            Cloud KMS Key used to encrypt this object, if
            the object is encrypted by such a key.
        update_storage_class_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time at which the object's storage class
            was last changed. When the object is initially created, it
            will be set to time_created. Attempting to set or update
            this field will result in a
            [FieldViolation][google.rpc.BadRequest.FieldViolation].
        temporary_hold (bool):
            Whether an object is under temporary hold.
            While this flag is set to true, the object is
            protected against deletion and overwrites.  A
            common use case of this flag is regulatory
            investigations where objects need to be retained
            while the investigation is ongoing. Note that
            unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not
            impact retention expiration time of an object.
        retention_expire_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            A server-determined value that specifies the earliest time
            that the object's retention period expires. This value is in
            [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339][RFC 3339] format. Note
            1: This field is not provided for objects with an active
            event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown
            until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be
            provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user
            can reason about policy without having to first unset the
            temporary hold).
        metadata (Sequence[google.storage_v2.types.Object.MetadataEntry]):
            User-provided metadata, in key/value pairs.
        event_based_hold (bool):
            Whether an object is under event-based hold. An event-based
            hold is a way to force the retention of an object until
            after some event occurs. Once the hold is released by
            explicitly setting this field to false, the object will
            become subject to any bucket-level retention policy, except
            that the retention duration will be calculated from the time
            the event based hold was lifted, rather than the time the
            object was created.

            In a WriteObject request, not setting this field implies
            that the value should be taken from the parent bucket's
            "default_event_based_hold" field. In a response, this field
            will always be set to true or false.
            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``_event_based_hold``.
        owner (google.storage_v2.types.Owner):
            Output only. The owner of the object. This will always be
            the uploader of the object. Attempting to set or update this
            field will result in a
            [FieldViolation][google.rpc.BadRequest.FieldViolation].
        customer_encryption (google.storage_v2.types.Object.CustomerEncryption):
            Metadata of customer-supplied encryption key,
            if the object is encrypted by such a key.
        custom_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            A user-specified timestamp set on an object.
