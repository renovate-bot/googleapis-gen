        Stores a new object and metadata.

        An object can be written either in a single message stream or in
        a resumable sequence of message streams. To write using a single
        stream, the client should include in the first message of the
        stream an ``WriteObjectSpec`` describing the destination bucket,
        object, and any preconditions. Additionally, the final message
        must set 'finish_write' to true, or else it is an error.

        For a resumable write, the client should instead call
        ``StartResumableWrite()`` and provide that method an
        ``WriteObjectSpec.`` They should then attach the returned
        ``upload_id`` to the first message of each following call to
        ``Create``. If there is an error or the connection is broken
        during the resumable ``Create()``, the client should check the
        status of the ``Create()`` by calling ``QueryWriteStatus()`` and
        continue writing from the returned ``persisted_size``. This may
        be less than the amount of data the client previously sent.

        The service will not view the object as complete until the
        client has sent a ``WriteObjectRequest`` with ``finish_write``
        set to ``true``. Sending any requests on a stream after sending
        a request with ``finish_write`` set to ``true`` will cause an
        error. The client **should** check the response it receives to
