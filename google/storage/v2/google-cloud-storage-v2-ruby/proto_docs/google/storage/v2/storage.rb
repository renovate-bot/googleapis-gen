      #     back from the end of the object to be returned. For example, if an object's
      #     length is 15 bytes, a ReadObjectRequest with `read_offset` = -5 and
      #     `read_limit` = 3 would return bytes 10 through 12 of the object. Requesting

      #     is no limit, and a negative `read_limit` will cause an error.
      #
      #     If the stream returns fewer bytes than allowed by the `read_limit` and no

      #     hold's release. After being released, such objects will be subject to
      #     bucket-level retention (if any).  One sample use case of this flag is for
      #     banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in
      #     full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being
      #     paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any
      #     number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the
      #     object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention
      #     duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold
      #     transitioned from true to false.  Objects under event-based hold cannot be
      #     deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed.

      #     temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object.
      # @!attribute [rw] retention_expire_time

      #   @return [::Boolean]
      #     Whether an object is under event-based hold.
      #     An event-based hold is a way to force the retention of an object until
      #     after some event occurs. Once the hold is released by explicitly setting
      #     this field to false, the object will become subject to any bucket-level
      #     retention policy, except that the retention duration will be calculated
      #     from the time the event based hold was lifted, rather than the time the
      #     object was created.
      #
      #     In a WriteObject request, not setting this field implies that the value
      #     should be taken from the parent bucket's "default_event_based_hold" field.
