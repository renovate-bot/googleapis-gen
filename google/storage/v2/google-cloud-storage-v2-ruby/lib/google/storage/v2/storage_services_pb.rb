          # An object can be written either in a single message stream or in a
          # resumable sequence of message streams. To write using a single stream,
          # the client should include in the first message of the stream an
          # `WriteObjectSpec` describing the destination bucket, object, and any
          # preconditions. Additionally, the final message must set 'finish_write' to
          # true, or else it is an error.
          #
          # For a resumable write, the client should instead call
          # `StartResumableWrite()` and provide that method an `WriteObjectSpec.`
          # They should then attach the returned `upload_id` to the first message of
          # each following call to `Create`. If there is an error or the connection is
          # broken during the resumable `Create()`, the client should check the status
          # of the `Create()` by calling `QueryWriteStatus()` and continue writing from
          # the returned `committed_size`. This may be less than the amount of data the
          # client previously sent.
          #
          # The service will not view the object as complete until the client has
          # sent a `WriteObjectRequest` with `finish_write` set to `true`. Sending any
          # requests on a stream after sending a request with `finish_write` set to
          # `true` will cause an error. The client **should** check the response it
          # receives to determine how much data the service was able to commit and
          # whether the service views the object as complete.

          # can then be used as the `write_offset` for the next `Write()` call.

          # If the object does not exist (i.e., the object has been deleted, or the
          # first `Write()` has not yet reached the service), this method returns the
          # error `NOT_FOUND`.
          #
          # The client **may** call `QueryWriteStatus()` at any time to determine how
          # much data has been processed for this object. This is useful if the
          # client is buffering data and needs to know which data can be safely
          # evicted. For any sequence of `QueryWriteStatus()` calls for a given
          # object name, the sequence of returned `committed_size` values will be
          # non-decreasing.
