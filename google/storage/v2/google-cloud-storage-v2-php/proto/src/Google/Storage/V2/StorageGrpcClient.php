     * An object can be written either in a single message stream or in a
     * resumable sequence of message streams. To write using a single stream,
     * the client should include in the first message of the stream an
     * `WriteObjectSpec` describing the destination bucket, object, and any
     * preconditions. Additionally, the final message must set 'finish_write' to
     * true, or else it is an error.
     *
     * For a resumable write, the client should instead call
     * `StartResumableWrite()` and provide that method an `WriteObjectSpec.`
     * They should then attach the returned `upload_id` to the first message of
     * each following call to `Create`. If there is an error or the connection is
     * broken during the resumable `Create()`, the client should check the status
     * of the `Create()` by calling `QueryWriteStatus()` and continue writing from
     * the returned `persisted_size`. This may be less than the amount of data the
     * client previously sent.
     *
     * The service will not view the object as complete until the client has
     * sent a `WriteObjectRequest` with `finish_write` set to `true`. Sending any
     * requests on a stream after sending a request with `finish_write` set to
     * `true` will cause an error. The client **should** check the response it
     * receives to determine how much data the service was able to commit and
     * whether the service views the object as complete.
