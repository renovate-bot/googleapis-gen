        ##
        # A service for requesting test executions and querying their status.
        #
        # This service is part of Firebase Test Lab. To learn about how to use the
        # product, and how to integrate it with your system,
        # visit https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab.
        #
        # Each test execution will wait for available capacity. It will then be
        # invoked as described. The test may be invoked multiple times if an
        # infrastructure failure is detected. Results and other files generated by
        # the test will be stored in an external storage system.
        #
        # The TestExecutionService models this behavior using two resource types:
        #
        # - TestMatrix: a group of one or more TestExecutions, built by taking a
        #   product of values over a pre-defined set of axes. In the case of Android
        #   Tests, for example, device model and OS version are two axes of the matrix.
        #
        # - TestExecution: a single execution of one or more test targets on a
        #   single device. These are created automatically when a TestMatrix is
        #   created.
        #
        # This service returns any error codes from the canonical error space (i.e.
        # google.rpc.Code). The errors which may be returned are specified on each
        # method. In addition, any method may return UNAVAILABLE or INTERNAL.
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a client:
        #
        #     require "google/devtools/testing/v1/test_execution_service"
        #     client = ::Google::Devtools::Testing::V1::TestExecutionService::Client.new
        #
        module TestExecutionService
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
