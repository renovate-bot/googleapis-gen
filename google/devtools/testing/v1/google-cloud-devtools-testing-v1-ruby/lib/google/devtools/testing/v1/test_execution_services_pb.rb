          # A service for requesting test executions and querying their status.
          #
          # This service is part of Firebase Test Lab. To learn about how to use the
          # product, and how to integrate it with your system,
          # visit https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab.
          #
          # Each test execution will wait for available capacity. It will then be
          # invoked as described. The test may be invoked multiple times if an
          # infrastructure failure is detected. Results and other files generated by
          # the test will be stored in an external storage system.
          #
          # The TestExecutionService models this behavior using two resource types:
          #
          # - TestMatrix: a group of one or more TestExecutions, built by taking a
          #   product of values over a pre-defined set of axes. In the case of Android
          #   Tests, for example, device model and OS version are two axes of the matrix.
          #
          # - TestExecution: a single execution of one or more test targets on a
          #   single device. These are created automatically when a TestMatrix is
          #   created.
          #
          # This service returns any error codes from the canonical error space (i.e.
          # google.rpc.Code). The errors which may be returned are specified on each
          # method. In addition, any method may return UNAVAILABLE or INTERNAL.
