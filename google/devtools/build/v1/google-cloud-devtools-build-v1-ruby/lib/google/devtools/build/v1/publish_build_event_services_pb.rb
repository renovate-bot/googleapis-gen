          # A service for publishing BuildEvents. BuildEvents are generated by Build
          # Systems to record actions taken during a Build. Events occur in streams,
          # are identified by a StreamId, and ordered by sequence number in a stream.
          #
          # A Build may contain several streams of BuildEvents, depending on the systems
          # that are involved in the Build. Some BuildEvents are used to declare the
          # beginning and end of major portions of a Build; these are called
          # LifecycleEvents, and are used (for example) to indicate the beginning or end
          # of a Build, and the beginning or end of an Invocation attempt (there can be
          # more than 1 Invocation in a Build if, for example, a failure occurs somewhere
          # and it needs to be retried).
          #
          # Other, build-tool events represent actions taken by the Build tool, such as
          # target objects produced via compilation, tests run, et cetera. There could be
          # more than one build tool stream for an invocation attempt of a build.
