    generated by Build Systems to record actions taken during a
    Build. Events occur in streams, are identified by a StreamId,
    and ordered by sequence number in a stream.
    A Build may contain several streams of BuildEvents, depending on
    the systems that are involved in the Build. Some BuildEvents are
    used to declare the beginning and end of major portions of a
    Build; these are called LifecycleEvents, and are used (for
    example) to indicate the beginning or end of a Build, and the
    beginning or end of an Invocation attempt (there can be more
    than 1 Invocation in a Build if, for example, a failure occurs
    somewhere and it needs to be retried).

    Other, build-tool events represent actions taken by the Build
    tool, such as target objects produced via compilation, tests
    run, et cetera. There could be more than one build tool stream
    for an invocation attempt of a build.
