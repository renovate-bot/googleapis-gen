        Attributes:
            arguments (Sequence[str]):
                The command itself to run (e.g., argv).

                This field should be passed directly to the underlying
                operating system, and so it must be sensible to that
                operating system. For example, on Windows, the first
                argument might be "C:\Windows\System32\ping.exe" - that is,
                using drive letters and backslashes. A command for a \*nix
                system, on the other hand, would use forward slashes.

                All other fields in the RWAPI must consistently use forward
                slashes, since those fields may be interpretted by both the
                service and the bot.

                other formats are allowed if better for the
                implementation (eg, a LUCI-style .isolated
                file).

                This field is repeated since implementations
                might want to cache the metadata, in which case
                it may be useful to break up portions of the
                filesystem that change frequently (eg, specific
                input files) from those that don't (eg, standard

                Inline contents for blobs expected to be needed by the bot

                ``files`` or blobs that are indirectly referenced by an
                entry there.

                The bot should check against this list before downloading
                required task inputs to reduce the number of communications
