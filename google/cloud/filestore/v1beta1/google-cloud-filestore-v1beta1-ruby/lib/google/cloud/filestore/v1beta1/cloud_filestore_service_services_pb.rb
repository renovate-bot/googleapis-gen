          #
          # The `file.googleapis.com` service implements the Cloud Filestore API and
          # defines the following model for managing resources:
          # * The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named: `/projects/*`
          # * Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/*`
          # * Each location has a collection of instances and backups, named:
          # `/instances/*` and `/backups/*` respectively.
          # * As such, Cloud Filestore instances are resources of the form:
          #   `/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
          #   backups are resources of the form:
          #   `/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/backup/{backup_id}`
          #
          # Note that location_id can represent a GCP `zone` or `region` depending on the
          # resource.
          # for example:
          # A zonal Filestore instance:
          # * `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-c/instances/my-basic-tier-filer`
          # A regional Filestore instance:
          # * `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/instances/my-enterprise-filer`
