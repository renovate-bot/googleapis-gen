        # Search all resources request.
        # @!attribute [rw] scope
        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The relative name of an asset. The search is limited to the resources
        #     within the `scope`. The allowed value must be:
        #     * Organization number (such as "organizations/123")
        #     * Folder number(such as "folders/1234")
        #     * Project number (such as "projects/12345")

        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. The query statement.
        # @!attribute [rw] asset_types
        #   @return [::Array<::String>]
        #     Optional. A list of asset types that this request searches for. If empty, it will
        #     search all the supported asset types.
        # @!attribute [rw] page_size
        #   @return [::Integer]
        #     Optional. The page size for search result pagination. Page size is capped at 500 even
        #     if a larger value is given. If set to zero, server will pick an appropriate
        #     default. Returned results may be fewer than requested. When this happens,
        #     there could be more results as long as `next_page_token` is returned.
        # @!attribute [rw] page_token
        #   @return [::String]

        #     to this method.  `page_token` must be the value of `next_page_token` from
        #     the previous response. The values of all other method parameters, must be
        #     identical to those in the previous call.

        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. A comma separated list of fields specifying the sorting order of the
        #     results. The default order is ascending. Add " desc" after the field name
        #     to indicate descending order. Redundant space characters are ignored. For
