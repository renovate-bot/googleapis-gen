        # a resource outside the Google Cloud resource hierarchy (such as Google
        # Kubernetes Engine clusters and objects), or a policy (e.g. Cloud IAM policy).
        # See [Supported asset
        # types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types)
        # for more information.
        # @!attribute [rw] update_time
        #   @return [::Google::Protobuf::Timestamp]
        #     The last update timestamp of an asset. update_time is updated when

        #     The full name of the asset. Example:

        #     There can be a maximum of one Cloud IAM policy set on any given resource.
        #     In addition, Cloud IAM policies inherit their granted access scope from any
        #     policies set on parent resources in the resource hierarchy. Therefore, the
        #     effectively policy is the union of both the policy set on this resource
        #     and each policy set on all of the resource's ancestry resource levels in
        #     the hierarchy. See

        #     The ancestry path of an asset in Google Cloud [resource
        #     hierarchy](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy),
        #     represented as a list of relative resource names. An ancestry path starts
        #     with the closest ancestor in the hierarchy and ends at root. If the asset
        #     is a project, folder, or organization, the ancestry path starts from the
        #     asset itself.
        #
