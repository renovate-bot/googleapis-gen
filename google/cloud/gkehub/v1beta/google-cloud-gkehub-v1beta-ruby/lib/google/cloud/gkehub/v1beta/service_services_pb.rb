          # The GKE Hub service handles the registration of many Kubernetes clusters to
          # Google Cloud, and the management of multi-cluster features over those
          # clusters.
          #
          # The GKE Hub service operates on the following resources:
          #
          # * [Membership][google.cloud.gkehub.v1beta.Membership]
          # * [Feature][google.cloud.gkehub.v1beta.Feature]
          #
          # GKE Hub is currently only available in the global region.
          #
          # **Membership management may be non-trivial:** it is recommended to use one
          # of the Google-provided client libraries or tools where possible when working
          # with Membership resources.
