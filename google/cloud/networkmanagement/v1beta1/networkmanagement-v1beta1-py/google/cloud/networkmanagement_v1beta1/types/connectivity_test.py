class ConnectivityTest(proto.Message):
    r"""A Connectivity Test for a network reachability analysis.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. Unique name of the resource using the form:
            ``projects/{project_id}/locations/global/connectivityTests/{test}``
        description (str):
            The user-supplied description of the
            Connectivity Test. Maximum of 512 characters.
        source (google.cloud.networkmanagement_v1beta1.types.Endpoint):
            Required. Source specification of the
            Connectivity Test.
            You can use a combination of source IP address,
            virtual machine (VM) instance, or Compute Engine
            network to uniquely identify the source
            location.

            Examples:
            If the source IP address is an internal IP
            address within a Google Cloud Virtual Private
            Cloud (VPC) network, then you must also specify
            the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM
            instance, which already contains its internal IP
            address and VPC network information.
            If the source of the test is within an on-
            premises network, then you must provide the
            destination VPC network.

            If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM
            instance with multiple network interfaces, the
            instance itself is not sufficient to identify
            the endpoint. So, you must also specify the
            source IP address or VPC network.
            A reachability analysis proceeds even if the
            source location is ambiguous. However, the test
            result may include endpoints that you don't
            intend to test.
        destination (google.cloud.networkmanagement_v1beta1.types.Endpoint):
            Required. Destination specification of the
            Connectivity Test.
            You can use a combination of destination IP
            address, Compute Engine VM instance, or VPC
            network to uniquely identify the destination
            location.

            Even if the destination IP address is not
            unique, the source IP location is unique.
            Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
            endpoint from route information.

            If the destination you specify is a VM instance
            and the instance has multiple network
            interfaces, then you must also specify either a
            destination IP address  or VPC network to
            identify the destination interface.

            A reachability analysis proceeds even if the
            destination location is ambiguous. However, the
            result can include endpoints that you don't
            intend to test.
        protocol (str):
            IP Protocol of the test. When not provided,
            "TCP" is assumed.
        related_projects (Sequence[str]):
            Other projects that may be relevant for
            reachability analysis. This is applicable to
            scenarios where a test can cross project
            boundaries.
        display_name (str):
            Output only. The display name of a
            Connectivity Test.
        labels (Sequence[google.cloud.networkmanagement_v1beta1.types.ConnectivityTest.LabelsEntry]):
            Resource labels to represent user-provided
            metadata.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time the test was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time the test's
            configuration was updated.
        reachability_details (google.cloud.networkmanagement_v1beta1.types.ReachabilityDetails):
            Output only. The reachability details of this
            test from the latest run. The details are
            updated when creating a new test, updating an
            existing test, or triggering a one-time rerun of
            an existing test.
        probing_details (google.cloud.networkmanagement_v1beta1.types.ProbingDetails):
            Output only. The probing details of this test
            from the latest run, present for applicable
            tests only. The details are updated when
            creating a new test, updating an existing test,
            or triggering a one-time rerun of an existing
            test.
