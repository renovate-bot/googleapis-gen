        #     Parentheses are not supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`.

        #

        #      * source_properties.a_property
        #      * security_marks.marks.marka

        #
        #     * `=` for all value types.
        #     * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values.

        #     * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes.
