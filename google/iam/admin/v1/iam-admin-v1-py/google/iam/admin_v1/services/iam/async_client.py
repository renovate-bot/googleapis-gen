    -  **Service accounts**, which identify an application or a virtual

    -  **Service account keys**, which service accounts use to
       authenticate with Google APIs

    -  **IAM custom roles**, which help you limit the number of
       permissions that you grant to members

    In addition, you can use this service to complete the following
    tasks, among others:

    -  Test whether a service account can use specific permissions
    -  Check which roles you can grant for a specific resource
    -  Lint, or validate, condition expressions in an IAM policy

                A service account has two sets of key-

                User-managed key-pairs can be created

                responsible for rotating these keys

                private key of these key-pairs, and
                Google retains ONLY the public key.

                System-managed keys are automatically
                rotated by Google, and are used for
                signing for a maximum of two weeks. The
                rotation process is probabilistic, and
                usage of the new key will gradually ramp
                up and down over the key's lifetime.

                If you cache the public key set for a
                service account, we recommend that you
                update the cache every 15 minutes. User-
                managed keys can be added and removed at
                any time, so it is important to update
                the cache frequently. For Google-managed

        Returns:
            google.iam.admin_v1.types.ServiceAccountKey:
                Represents a service account key.
                A service account has two sets of key-
                pairs: user-managed, and system-managed.

                User-managed key-pairs can be created
                and deleted by users.  Users are
                responsible for rotating these keys
                periodically to ensure security of their
                service accounts.  Users retain the
                private key of these key-pairs, and
                Google retains ONLY the public key.

                System-managed keys are automatically
                rotated by Google, and are used for
                signing for a maximum of two weeks. The
                rotation process is probabilistic, and
                usage of the new key will gradually ramp
                up and down over the key's lifetime.

                If you cache the public key set for a
                service account, we recommend that you
                update the cache every 15 minutes. User-
                managed keys can be added and removed at
                any time, so it is important to update
                the cache frequently. For Google-managed
                keys, Google will publish a key at least
                6 hours before it is first used for
                signing and will keep publishing it for
                at least 6 hours after it was last used
                for signing.

                Public keys for all service accounts are
                also published at the OAuth2 Service
                Account API.

                   specify access control policies for Cloud Platform
                   resources.

                   A Policy is a collection of bindings. A binding binds
                   one or more members to a single role. Members can be
                   user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and
                   domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of
                   permissions (defined by IAM or configured by users).
                   A binding can optionally specify a condition, which
                   is a logic expression that further constrains the
                   role binding based on attributes about the request
                   and/or target resource.

        Use this method to grant or revoke access to the service

        impersonate the service account.

        This method does not enable the service account to access other
        resources. To grant roles to a service account on a resource,
        follow these steps:

        1. Call the resource's ``getIamPolicy`` method to get its
           current IAM policy.
        2. Edit the policy so that it binds the service account to an
           IAM role for the resource.
        3. Call the resource's ``setIamPolicy`` method to update its IAM
           policy.

        account for specific
        resources <https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/service-accounts/granting-access-to-service-accounts>`__.
