                Represents a service account key.
                A service account has two sets of key-
                pairs: user-managed, and system-managed.

                User-managed key-pairs can be created
                and deleted by users.  Users are
                responsible for rotating these keys
                periodically to ensure security of their
                service accounts.  Users retain the
                private key of these key-pairs, and
                Google retains ONLY the public key.

                System-managed keys are automatically
                rotated by Google, and are used for
                signing for a maximum of two weeks. The
                rotation process is probabilistic, and
                usage of the new key will gradually ramp
                up and down over the key's lifetime.

                If you cache the public key set for a
                service account, we recommend that you
                update the cache every 15 minutes. User-
                managed keys can be added and removed at
                any time, so it is important to update
                the cache frequently. For Google-managed
                keys, Google will publish a key at least
                6 hours before it is first used for
                signing and will keep publishing it for
                at least 6 hours after it was last used
                for signing.

                Public keys for all service accounts are
                also published at the OAuth2 Service
                Account API.

            name (str):
                Required. The resource name of the service account in
                the following format:
                ``projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}``.
                Using ``-`` as a wildcard for the ``PROJECT_ID`` will
                infer the project from the account. The ``ACCOUNT``
                value can be the ``email`` address or the ``unique_id``
                of the service account.

                This corresponds to the ``name`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            private_key_type (google.iam.admin_v1.types.ServiceAccountPrivateKeyType):
                The output format of the private key. The default value
                is ``TYPE_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE``, which is the Google
                Credentials File format.

                This corresponds to the ``private_key_type`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            key_algorithm (google.iam.admin_v1.types.ServiceAccountKeyAlgorithm):
                Which type of key and algorithm to
                use for the key. The default is
                currently a 2K RSA key.  However this
                may change in the future.

                This corresponds to the ``key_algorithm`` field

            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,

                Represents a service account key.
                A service account has two sets of key-
                pairs: user-managed, and system-managed.

                User-managed key-pairs can be created
                and deleted by users.  Users are
                responsible for rotating these keys
                periodically to ensure security of their
                service accounts.  Users retain the
                private key of these key-pairs, and
                Google retains ONLY the public key.

                System-managed keys are automatically
                rotated by Google, and are used for
                signing for a maximum of two weeks. The
                rotation process is probabilistic, and
                usage of the new key will gradually ramp
                up and down over the key's lifetime.

                If you cache the public key set for a
                service account, we recommend that you
                update the cache every 15 minutes. User-
                managed keys can be added and removed at
                any time, so it is important to update
                the cache frequently. For Google-managed
                keys, Google will publish a key at least
                6 hours before it is first used for
                signing and will keep publishing it for
                at least 6 hours after it was last used
                for signing.

                The resource name of the service account in the
                following format:
                ``projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}``.
                Using ``-`` as a wildcard for the ``PROJECT_ID`` will
                infer the project from the account. The ``ACCOUNT``
                value can be the ``email`` address or the ``unique_id``
                of the service account.

                This corresponds to the ``name`` field

                If the JWT Claims Set contains an expiration time
                (``exp``) claim, it must be an integer timestamp that is
                not in the past and no more than 1 hour in the future.

                If the JWT Claims Set does not contain an expiration
                time (``exp``) claim, this claim is added automatically,
                with a timestamp that is 1 hour in the future.

                This corresponds to the ``payload`` field

        -  If an IAM policy contains a binding to the custom role, the
