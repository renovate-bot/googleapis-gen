        # Creates and manages Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources.
        #
        # You can use this service to work with all of the following resources:
        #
        # * **Service accounts**, which identify an application or a virtual machine
        #   (VM) instance rather than a person
        # * **Service account keys**, which service accounts use to authenticate with
        #   Google APIs
        # * **IAM policies for service accounts**, which specify the roles that a
        #   member has for the service account
        # * **IAM custom roles**, which help you limit the number of permissions that
        #   you grant to members
        #
        # In addition, you can use this service to complete the following tasks, among
        # others:
        #
        # * Test whether a service account can use specific permissions
        # * Check which roles you can grant for a specific resource
        # * Lint, or validate, condition expressions in an IAM policy
        #
        # To load this service and instantiate a client:
        #
        #     require "google/iam/admin/v1/iam"
        #     client = ::Google::Iam::Admin::V1::IAM::Client.new
        #
