          # You can use this service to work with all of the following resources:
          #
          # * **Service accounts**, which identify an application or a virtual machine
          #   (VM) instance rather than a person
          # * **Service account keys**, which service accounts use to authenticate with
          #   Google APIs
          # * **IAM policies for service accounts**, which specify the roles that a
          #   member has for the service account
          # * **IAM custom roles**, which help you limit the number of permissions that
          #   you grant to members
          #
          # In addition, you can use this service to complete the following tasks, among
          # others:
          #
          # * Test whether a service account can use specific permissions
          # * Check which roles you can grant for a specific resource
          # * Lint, or validate, condition expressions in an IAM policy
