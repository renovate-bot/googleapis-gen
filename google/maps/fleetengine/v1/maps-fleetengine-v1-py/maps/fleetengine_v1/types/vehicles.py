            The format is
            providers/{provider}/vehicles/{vehicle}
        vehicle_state (maps.fleetengine_v1.types.VehicleState):
            The vehicle state.
        supported_trip_types (Sequence[maps.fleetengine_v1.types.TripType]):
            Supported trip types.
        current_trips (Sequence[str]):
            List of IDs for trips in progress.
        last_location (maps.fleetengine_v1.types.VehicleLocation):
            Last reported location of the vehicle.
        maximum_capacity (int):
            Maximum capacity of the vehicle.  This is the
            total numbers of riders on trips this vehicle
            can contain.  The driver is not considered in
            this value.  This value must be greater than or
            equal to one.
        available_capacity (int):
            The current available capacity of the vehicle. This is the
            maximum_capacity minus the current number of riders.
        attributes (Sequence[maps.fleetengine_v1.types.VehicleAttribute]):
            List of vehicle service attributes.
        vehicle_type (maps.fleetengine_v1.types.Vehicle.VehicleType):
            The type of this Vehicle.  Can be filtered
            during SearchVehicles.  Also influences ETA and
            route calculations.
        license_plate (maps.fleetengine_v1.types.LicensePlate):
            License plate information for the vehicle.
        route (Sequence[maps.fleetengine_v1.types.TerminalLocation]):
            Deprecated. Use vehicle.waypoint instead.
        current_route_segment (str):
            The polyline specifying the route the driver app intends to
            take to the next waypoint. Your driver app updates this
            every time a waypoint is passed or the driver reroutes. This
            list is also returned in Trip.current_route_segment for all
            active trips assigned to the vehicle. Note: This field is
            intended only for use by the Driver SDK.
        current_route_segment_version (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Time when current_route_segment was set. This field is
            ignored in UpdateVehicleRequests as it is calculated by the
            server. It should be stored by client and passed in to
            future requests to prevent returning routes to first way
            point that haven't changed.
        current_route_segment_end_point (maps.fleetengine_v1.types.TripWaypoint):
            The waypoint where current_route_segment ends. This can be
            supplied by drivers on UpdateVehicle calls either as a full
            trip waypoint, a waypoint latlnt, or as a the last latlng of
            the current_route_segment. FleetEngine will then do its best
            to interpolate to an actual waypoint if it is not fully
            specified. This field is ignored in UpdateVehicle calls
            unless current_route_segment is also specified.
        remaining_distance_meters (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.Int32Value):
            The remaining driving distance for the
            'current_route_segment'. This field facilitates journey
            sharing between the Driver app and the Consumer app. This
            value is updated by the Driver SDK. Fleet Engine does not
            update it. This field is also returned in
            Trip.remaining_distance_meters for all active trips assigned
            to the vehicle. The value is unspecified if the
            ``Vehicle.current_route_segment`` field is empty, or if the
            Driver app has not updated its value.
        eta_to_first_waypoint (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The ETA to the next waypoint that is the first entry in
            Vehicle.waypoint field. This field facilitates journey
            sharing between a Driver app and a Consumer app and is
            updated by the Driver SDK, and Fleet Engine does not update
            it. This field is also returned in
            Trip.eta_to_first_waypoint for all active trips assigned to
            the vehicle. The value is unspecified if the
            Vehicle.waypoint field is empty, or the Driver app has not
            updated its value.
        remaining_time_seconds (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.Int32Value):
            The remaining driving time for the 'current_route_segment'.
            This field facilitates journey sharing between the Driver
            app and the Consumer app. This value is updated by the
            Driver SDK. Fleet Engine does not update it. The value is
            unspecified if the ``Vehicle.current_route_segment`` field
            is empty, or if the Driver app has not updated its value.
            This value should match eta_to_first_waypoint - current_time
            if all parties are using the same clock. This field is
            currently write-only and will not yet be populated in
            Vehicle's get/update/search operations. When updating a
            vehicle, if you update both eta_to_first_waypoint and
            remaining_time_seconds in the same request, then only
            remaining_time_seconds is considered.
        waypoints (Sequence[maps.fleetengine_v1.types.TripWaypoint]):
            The remaining set of waypoints assigned to
            this Vehicle.
        waypoints_version (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Last time the waypoints was updated. Client should cache
            this value and pass it in GetVehicleRequest to ensure the
            waypoints.path_to_waypoint is only returned if it is updated
        back_to_back_enabled (bool):
            Indicates if the driver accepts back-to-back rides. If
            ``true``, services include the vehicle for back-to-back
            matches. If ``false``, services exclude the vehicle from
            back-to-back matches. Default value is ``false``.
        navigation_status (maps.fleetengine_v1.types.NavigationStatus):
            Vehicle's navigation status.
        device_settings (maps.fleetengine_v1.types.DeviceSettings):
            Information about various device settings.
            This is internal debug only field, not included
            in the response.
