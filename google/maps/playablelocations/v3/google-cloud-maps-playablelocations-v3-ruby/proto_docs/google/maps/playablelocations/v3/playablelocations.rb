        # Life of a query:
        #
        # - When a game starts in a new location, your game server issues a
        # {::Google::Maps::Playablelocations::V3::PlayableLocations::Client#sample_playable_locations SamplePlayableLocations}
        # request. The request specifies the S2 cell, and contains one or more
        # "criteria" for filtering:
        #
        # - Criterion 0: i locations for long-lived bases, or level 0 monsters, or...
        # - Criterion 1: j locations for short-lived bases, or level 1 monsters, ...
        # - Criterion 2: k locations for random objects.
        # - etc (up to 5 criterion may be specified).
        #
        # `PlayableLocationList` will then contain mutually
        # exclusive lists of `PlayableLocation` objects that satisfy each of
        # the criteria. Think of it as a collection of real-world locations that you
        # can then associate with your game state.
        #
        # Note: These points are impermanent in nature. E.g, parks can close, and
        # places can be removed.
        #
        # The response specifies how long you can expect the playable locations to
        # last. Once they expire, you should query the `samplePlayableLocations` API
        # again to get a fresh view of the real world.
