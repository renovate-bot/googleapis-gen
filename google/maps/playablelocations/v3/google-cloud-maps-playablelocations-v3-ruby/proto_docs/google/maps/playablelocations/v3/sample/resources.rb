          #     The spacing is a greedy algorithm. It optimizes for selecting the highest
          #     ranking locations first, not to maximize the number of locations selected.

          #
          #       * Rank: A: 2, B: 1, C: 3.

          #
          #     Spacing works within the game object type itself, as well as the previous
          #     ones.
          #     Suppose three game object types, each with the following spacing:
          #
          #       * X: 400m, Y: undefined, Z: 200m.
          #
          #     1. Add locations for X, within 400m of each other.
          #     2. Add locations for Y, without any spacing.
          #     3. Finally, add locations for Z within 200m of each other as well X and Y.
          #
          #     The distance diagram between those locations end up as:
          #
          #       * From->To.
          #       * X->X: 400m
