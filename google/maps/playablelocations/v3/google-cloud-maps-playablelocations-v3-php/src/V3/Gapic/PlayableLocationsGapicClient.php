     *     @type string|array|FetchAuthTokenInterface|CredentialsWrapper $credentials
     *           The credentials to be used by the client to authorize API calls. This option
     *           accepts either a path to a credentials file, or a decoded credentials file as a

     *           Client method configuration, including retry settings. This option can be either
     *           a path to a JSON file, or a PHP array containing the decoded JSON data. By

     *           The transport used for executing network requests. May be either the string
     *           `rest` or `grpc`. Defaults to `grpc` if gRPC support is detected on the system.
     *           *Advanced usage*: Additionally, it is possible to pass in an already
