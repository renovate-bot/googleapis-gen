        #   @return [::String]
        #     Required. The full resource name of the model. The model id is the same as
        #     the build target id for non-unified builds.
        #     For example,

        #   @return [::String]
        #     Optional. A page token, received from a previous `ListBuilds` call. Provide this to

        #   @return [::String]

        #     builds in milestone 80.

        #     fields will be returned.
        #     Valid fields: name, milestone, build_version.
        #     For example, if the read_mask is set as `read_mask='milestone'`, the
        #     ListBuilds will return a list of Builds object with only the milestone
        #     field.
        # @!attribute [rw] group_by

        #     mask. The group_by field should be the same as the read_mask field in
        #     convention of SQL.
