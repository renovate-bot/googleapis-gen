    This API represents a simple digital library. It lets you manage
    Shelf resources and Book resources in the library. It defines the
    following resource model:

    -  The API has a collection of
       [Shelf][google.example.library.v1.Shelf] resources, named
       ``shelves/*``

    -  Each Shelf has a collection of
       [Book][google.example.library.v1.Book] resources, named
       ``shelves/*/books/*``

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
